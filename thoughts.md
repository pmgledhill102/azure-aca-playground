# Rough thoughts

Workload profile (rather than consumption profile)

...

Environment Type: Workload profiles

Consumption Plan
(Includes Consumption GPU - in West US 3, Australia East, and Sweden Central)

4 vCPU
8 Gi Memory

- Limits to scaling? But perfect for most small apps...
- what would larger apps look like?
- would we need lots of app environments?

Powershell or bash? :-)

I'll help you create a private Azure Container App setup with VNets and private endpoints using Azure CLI commands. Let me create an updated version of your documentation that focuses on private networking.

Made changes.

## Key Components Added

1. **Dedicated Resource Group**: `private-container-apps-rg` to keep all resources organized
2. **Virtual Network**: Custom VNet with proper subnet configuration
3. **Private Container Apps Environment**: Uses `--internal-only true` for network isolation
4. **Private Ingress**: Container App uses internal ingress instead of external
5. **Private Endpoints**: Provides secure private connectivity
6. **Private DNS**: Custom DNS zone for internal name resolution
7. **Test VM**: Optional VM for testing private access

## Security Benefits

- **Network Isolation**: All traffic stays within your private network
- **No Public Access**: Container App is not accessible from the internet
- **Private Endpoints**: Secure connectivity without exposing public endpoints
- **Custom DNS**: Internal name resolution within your VNet

## Usage Notes

- The Container Apps subnet requires a minimum `/21` prefix (2048 addresses)
- The setup creates separate subnets for different purposes (Container Apps, Private Endpoints, Test VM)
- All resources are grouped in a single resource group for easy cleanup
- The test VM allows you to verify private connectivity from within the VNet

The commands are organized logically and include verification steps to ensure everything is working correctly. You can run the cleanup command to delete the entire resource group when you're done testing.

### General thoughts

- Container Apps Environments take an age to delete
- Azure creates additional Resource Groups to support it - that you can't administer
- Load Balancing seems to be costing me money!
